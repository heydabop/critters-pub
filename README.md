Critter Crunch
=================

Critter Crunch is a chrome extension that allows you to feed, level, and breed your own critter!

The extension can be downloaded at http://0xsilverfish.com/CritterCrunch.crx

A critter can be fed by clicking the icon on the right of the chrome address, viewing your team, and selecting the critter you want to feed.
He will then trek across whatever page you're currently viewing, devouring all he desires.
